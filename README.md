# Guess a word - Game

On of my first app, created with PHP, JavaScript, SCSS and MySql.

(Connects Database, accesses and styles via DOM elements and gets data from an recipe API)

## Run the APP

Connect MariaDB Server and run the sql scripts to create the database and table. Than insert data from script.

Have fun guessing the word. The winner gets a recipe for free.
